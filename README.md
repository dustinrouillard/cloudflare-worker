# Cloudflare Worker Template

This is a cloudflare worker starter template that uses Typescript, and a route parser to give you a level of route control that a more traditional api library would provide.

## Documentation

I will come through and write all the features and functionality of this worker template in a few days.

For now the important things to note is that you need to fill out the wrangler.toml with your details and you can use the npm commands (deploy, and devploy) to deploy them to cloudflare.
